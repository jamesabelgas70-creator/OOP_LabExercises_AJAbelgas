EXER 2: This Java code defines a Car class and a CarTester class. The Car class stores information about a car's brand, model, color, chassis number, and plate number. It uses a special method called a constructor to create a car object with all this data.

The most notable part of this code is the use of factory methods like createToyota() and createHonda(). Instead of directly calling the constructor, these static methods are used to create specific, pre-configured Car objects. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

Key Components
Exer2_Car class: The blueprint for a car object. It holds all the car's details as private variables. This means they can only be accessed or changed within this class. The class also contains:

Constructor: The public Exer2_Car(...) method is used to create a new Exer2_Car object and initialize its variables with the provided values.

Factory Methods: The static methods (createToyota(), createHonda(), etc.) are a convenient way to create pre-set car objects. This hides the complexity of creating the object with all its parameters.

displayDetails() method: This method simply prints all the car's details to the console in a readable format.

Exer2_CarTester class: The main program that runs the code. It:

Creates three different Car objects using the factory methods: c1 (a Toyota Vios), c2 (a Honda Civic), and c3 (a Toyota Alphard).

Calls the displayDetails() method for each car object to print their information.

In short, the code creates and displays the details of three different cars using a factory pattern to simplify the creation process.
